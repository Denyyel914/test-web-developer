DZAP Front-end Developer Test
=============================

**Please clone/download the test from the following location**
- https://github.com/dzap/front-end-dev-test

Please develop the provided website mockup using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A layered photoshop file has been provided. Please contact edrick@dzap.net if any instruction is unclear.

**Rules and Requirements**
- You may use any html/css/js library or framework, except in a few special cases which are detailed below. However keep in mind we are more interested in simplicity, and your command of the front-end development languages, than libraries and frameworks.
- For the comments area, please use the data within the provided javascript file. Populate the comments area with this data according to the mockup. Please order the comments beginning with the most recent. You may edit the data only to fix mistakes or malformations.
- For the large image area, please build a simple fade-in, fade-out slideshow with javascript. Please have it automatically rotate through the provided slideshow images. You may use a library such as jQuery. You may NOT use a prebuilt slideshow plugin like bxSlider, Cycle, or Slick.
- Please use your judgement to make this page responsive. It doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy, just an appropriately styled mobile and desktop version. A single breakpoint will suffice. You may use a framework if you like, but extra consideration will be given if you can example your command of simple media queries.
- Please ensure the page is functional in IE9+. Pixel perfection is not required, but please ensure the page is functional.
